# Nieves Response

### Our question related to the reading for today.  Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally?  Describe in detail how random forest works.  What is a dasymetric population allocation? Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

Random forest works by pooling together a bunch of covariates from a place that affect where people are likely to reside. These covariates are run through an algorithm that gets rid of the covariates that are of little importance to the results, and the covariates that remain are used to make weights to determine what portions of the region are more populated than others. These weights are combined with the census data for that area and form a more accurate representation of where the population resides throughout an area. A dasymetric population allocation is what is described above, using covariates such as land cover and transportation routes to build weights based on where it is likely certain percentages of people are living. These weights are combined with the census data for that area and allow the data to be spread more accuartely over an area. When predicting global values of where humans reside, it turns out urban/suburban extents, built environment and urban/suburban proxies, climatic/environmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportation networks were the five most important covariates. These had the most effect on where people chose to live, which is unsurprising considering the urban aspects of an area tend to be a driving factor when people are choosing a place to settle down.
