### How did the transformation of the City of God provide evidence for how social networks were central to Rio de Janeiro's urbanization during the 60s, 70s, and 80s?

In the movie *City of God*, there is a lot of violence that occurs on an everyday basis, which is considered to be normal for the city. Gangs hunt each other down through the city and gunshots are a regular occurence. It is not uncommon for police to be running through the streets, shooting people down, whether or not that person is innocent or guilty. In a place such as the City of God, cops tend to follow the rule: peoople are guilty if they run away and shoot first, ask questions later. With so much crime rampant around the city, the question arises, how did the City of God evolve to become this way? In order to answer this question, one needs to dive into the role social networks play in the city and how they have allowed for the city to become the way it is. Ultimately, the transformation of the City of God provides evidence for how social networks were central to Rio de Janeiro's urbanization during the 60s, 70s, and 80s through the social interactions that take place between the citizens of the city, the way people naturally evolve and seek innovation and wealth, and the role greed takes as a driving force behind people's actions.

While Rio de Janeiro's City of God seems excessively violent compared to cities all over the world, the truth is that cities are based on the people and for the most part, evolve pretty much the same way based on how people interact with each other. Now, one thing that makes Rio de Janeiro so different is the social interactions between the people. Growing up, all the kids living in the City of God see violence on a daily basis, including that of their families. They are raised with gun shots, stealing, and drugs and consider those things to be extremely cool. In cities, it is hard to escape social interactions with others since over time, people interact with groups and individuals to fill the available "socioeconomic space." Therefore, these children are very likely to interact with gang members and choose to follow the behaviors they consider to be popular and cool. They are inundated with a certain behavior of how people act from a young age which is why the line at the beginning of the movie is so critical. "If you run, the beast catches you. If you stay, the beast eats you." It is extremely difficult to escape a life of crime when it is so prevalent throughout the city and people living there to some degree do interact with the community there. For example, Rocket tries to go to school and get a job, but struggles to do so, like when Lil Z takes the camera Benny gives Rocket. At one point, even Rocket attempts to try a life of crime because that is what he has been raised with, but he cannot do it since it goes against his nature and eventually escapes the beast by persevering in his values. Those that do not run, however, normally end up dead at a young age, such as Lil Z who embraced a life of crime and was killed as a young man. 

Another aspect of social networks that explains the evolution of the City of God is simply the need to involve and innovate. Throughout history, when someone can do something better than what has previously been accepted, they take over and the new method dies out. People are always looking to improve and the world fosters survival of the fittest. This can be seen in the City of God with the evolution of the gangs. First off, the Tender Trio consist of three guys who are the gangsters of the city. They steal things and commit crimes, but try to avoid killing people and ultimately either are shot by the cops or decide to split from the group. Lil Z follows their example for a time, but he builds on their failures by making the choice to kill people and pay off the cops, which is evident when the cops release Lil Z after arresting him. Additionally, Lil Z decides to take over the drug business instead of always robbing places, because it is safer and earns him higher profits. Lil Z has clearly evolved from the Tender Trio and lasts much longer than they ever did with his innovative methods. The next group that comes along, the Runts, continue to evolve by starting out as a larger group working together and killing at very young ages. They learned from Lil Z what to do but knew numbers was key from the start, which is how they defeated Lil Z, whereas Lil Z's closest friend was Benny, who was killed.

One last important aspect of social networks is greed and the desire for a better quality of life. Just like animals, people want to maximize their abilities to live longer, which can be done through power and wealth. The desire to succeed tends to overwhelm the desire to help others, which explains all of the killings that happen in the City of God. In the movie, every heist and raid, for the most part, is done due to greed. The Tender Trio steal items because they want the money. The same goes for Lil Z when it comes to taking over the drug business, but he is also keen on gaining power. Lil Z is addicted to the rush power killing people brings him and he wants to be in charge of the city. That is why he takes over all of the drug businesses and fights so hard against Carrot in the end. Benny manages to protect Carrot for a brief amount of time due to the desire to help others, but once Benny is gone, Lil Z's greed overpowers any thoughts of helping Carrot and Lil Z fights Carrot to the death. The Runts continue this legacy when they start killing and want to get into the drug business because the drug business is so lucrative. The people in the City of God have been raised on scraps and have been poor their whole lives. They want nothing more than to have money and wealth and are willing to do anything to achieve that.

Social interactions, the need to evolve and innovate, and greed are all driving factors behind the way the City of God evolves during the 60s, 70s, and 80s in Rio de Janeiro. They influence how people interact with each others and motivate the citizens to commit the crimes that they do. The City of God is a complex system and is affected by each of these factors and will keep evolving and changing as time goes on. There is one thing that is consistent within cities and that is change. While cities tend to stand for centuries and are hard to knock down, they are persistant in changing with times in order to keep up.
