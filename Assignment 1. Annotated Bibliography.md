   ​	available satellite data for urban research: Mapping built-up land cover 	and land use in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.” *ScienceDirect*, Elsevier B.V., 	21 Mar. 2018, www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S23527285173	00842. 



​	Urbanization has played a huge role in the past couple hundred years and continues to grow to this day. With this trend taking place across the world, it is important that there is proper data available addressing the land cover and usage of each country. The issue with that, however, is the fact that many countries do not have the money or infrastructure to bring about such studies and collect reliable data about the levels of urbanization occurring. Fortunately, new methods are coming about to map this data through the rising availability of remotely sensed data. By using the publicly available satellite data, countries can more easily monitor what is happening on their land and use that data to work to address issues such as the increased pollution levels due to urbanization.	

​	In his article about human development, Amartya Sen discusses the idea that the point of human development is “the process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy” (Sen 3). When comparing his words to this article on the growing urbanization in Vietnam, there are two freedoms that seem to clash against each other: urbanization and protecting the environment. On one hand, urbanization helps to lower poverty rates, but on the other, if it is left unchecked, it can lead to dire environmental consequences. Without the right policies and preparation, cities can cause heavy pollution that is extremely damaging to ecosystems all over the world. These factors present a dilemma: either help those facing poverty rid themselves of that unfreedom through urbanization or crack down on the development of cities to protect the freedom of all people to live in a healthy environment. Ultimately, a compromise is necessary because neither one of these freedoms can be eliminated.	

​	This article is addressing the issue of the rapid urbanization taking place in Vietnam and how Vietnam’s land usage is having negative effects on the environment. Some sustainable development goals for this issue would be to enact policies that cut down on air pollution, support public transportation, and push for the protection of lands used for agriculture. In order to narrow this study on a specific area, the authors chose Ho Chi Minh City as their focus. They created a map of the land coverage and land usage that encompasses the expanse of Ho Chi Minh City and categorized the data into built-up or not-built-up sections, further dividing the built-up part by splitting it into residential and non-residential groups. Then, data from the built-up sections was taken and put into a table describing what infrastructures occupy those spaces and maps were made with that spatial data to provide a picture of what is going on.	

​	Ultimately, the authors are studying the urbanization trends in Vietnam, specifically in the city of Ho Chi Minh due to the prevalence of data available for that location. They want to prove why using the publicly available satellite data opens up so many doors when it comes to the ability to continuously monitor certain situations and how it allows people gain access to information that can help with issues such as urban planning, climate change, and pollution prevention.
