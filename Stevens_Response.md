### In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works? 

The name of this technique is the Random Forest estimation technique and it essentially uses census data and other covariates to distribute the population data based on different weights for different areas. The algorithm goes through the covariates and determines which ones are most relevant to where the population is aggregated and to what degree in what sections of the country. From there, those covariates are used to distribute where people are located and in what numbers.

### The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

In general, a machine learning algorithm is a program that runs through data and follows specified rules to do certain actions with the data. Random forest can be used at a large-scale and only requires census data and covariates whereas the classical statistical approaches are often used at small geographic scales and are dependent on highly detailed population count or density information for model estimation, along with having a tendency to place restrictive demands on distributional requirements and assumptions.  

### In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

The geospatial covariates that the authors used included land cover, climate, elevation levels, road maps, night time lighting grids, waterways, large bodies of water, settlements or places of gathering, protected areas, facility locations, along with other relevant covariates that could affect where people are living. These covariates represented a large data set considering there were several covariates each with sizeable numbers of pixels. The significance of big data when it comes to machine learning is the fact that the immense numbers of data collected show patterns and by using data science methods such as machine learning, people can determine the correlations and drivers of human development. 

### The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

Having a highly accurate description of where each person is across the country is extremely beneficial when it comes to human development in LMICs because it shows were poverty rates are the highest and what areas need the most aid, schools, hospitals, or other resources to help increase one's quality of life. People can take action once they have the knowledge in their hands, but struggle to do so effectively if they are unable to figure out what areas need the most help.

### Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

My project seeks to uncover what factors are causing a lack of education in Nigeria and how this is having a negative impact on Nigeria's economy. With accurate data of where everyone lives in Nigeria, it becomes possible to discover what areas lack schools and where schools are most desperately need, along with what sections of the country have more schools than are necessary for their location. If there is an overabunadance of schools in one area, then that means there is less funding for places that have no education.
