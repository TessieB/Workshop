# Stevens Response
### In the reading today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works? 

The name of this technique is the Random Forest estimation technique and it essentially uses census data and other covariates to distribute the population data based on different weights for different areas. The algorithm goes through the covariates and determines which ones are most relevant to where the population is aggregated and to what degree in what sections of the country. From there those covariates are used to distribute where people are located and in what numbers.

### The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?



### In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

The geospatial covariates that the authors used included land cover, climate, elevation levels, road maps, night time lighting grids, waterways, large bodies of water, settlements or places of gathering, protected areas, facility locations, along with other relevant covariates that could affect where people are living. 

### The authorsâ€™ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?
### Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?
