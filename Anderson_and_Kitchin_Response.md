# Anderson and Kitchin Response
### Question: In Anderson's 2008 Wired article he describes how the data deluge is serving to make the scientific theory obsolete. Kitchin provides a rebuttal to Anderson's argument that theory is dead with his supposition that in fact we have entered a fourth paradigm. What do you think? Do you believe theory is dead? Do you think we have indeed entered a paradigm shifting revolution for how we describe, analyze and understand the world. 

Looking at these articles, both authors make compelling arguments. Kitchin's point, however, seems more accurate when describing the effects of big data on scientific theory. He explains that the world is entering a new paradigm, with a hybridization of data and scientific methods, which is contrary to Anderson's belief that scientific theory is dead. According to Anderson, big data should be the main form of theory now. Scientific theory becomes irrelevant when one can just look at the data and make connections. Anderson claims that hypotheses, observations, and tests are no longer necessary because the data contains all of the facts, and if one simply analyzes the data then they will be able to understand the reasoning behind a problem. Another point Anderson brings up is the idea that correlation can be used to prove causation, which goes against one of the fundamental rules of scientific theory. He believes that people make mistakes and have trouble noticing patterns, but if one just throws all of the massive amounts of data into a computer and runs it through a bunch of algorithms, then the computer will show answers that people would have never been able to find on their own through science. 

While Anderson makes some solid points in his argument, there are some fatal flaws that Kitchin points out in Anderson's assertion. First off, he starts his rebuttal by saying that no matter how much data exists, it will always be a sample and therefore is subject to sampling bias. Kitchin continues on to say that the systems used to capture big data do so with a purpose in mind, meaning that the data is sought out for a specific study and any patterns are based off of data relating to that case, ignoring all of the other data items that have not been collected. His third point addresses the fact that data cannot analyze itself and that humans are necessary, but will make mistakes and try to twist the data to fit with their research. Additionally, Kitchin discusses the point that correlation does not equal cause, because correlations with certain data sets can happen randomly when the two variables ultimately have no association with each other. Finally, Kitchin ends his four points by reminding people that data is not easy for everyone to read, and most people are not experts, thus indicating that any information gleaned from big data by someone who lacks experience in the field is likely to be unhelpful.

Overall, Kitchin has the stronger argument because data is not omniscient and can only show patterns, but no causes or explanations. In order for science to progress, experiments and other scientific methods are necessary so that the reasoning behind why things are the way they are can be discovered. Ultimately, there needs to be a balance between the use of data and scientific theory moving forwards, in order to maximize advances in science. The world is entering a new paradigm for how the things are to be analyzed and understood because there is so much data that has the potential to open endless opportunities. If the world is to experience the most growth, it must use whatever resources it has, including data, which means people must adjust to this new way of looking at the world.
