# Anderson and Kitchin Response
### Question: In Anderson's 2008 Wired article he describes how the data deluge is serving to make the scientific theory obsolete. Kitchin provides a rebuttal to Anderson's argument that theory is dead with his supposition that in fact we have entered a fourth paradigm. What do you think? Do you believe theory is dead? Do you think we have indeed entered a paradigm shifting revolution for how we describe, analyze and understand the world. 

Looking at these articles, both authors make compelling arguments. Kitchin's point, however, seems more accurate when describing the effects of big data on scientific theory. He explains that ..., which is contrary to Anderson's belief that scientific theory is dead. According to Anderson, big data should be the main form of theory now. Scientific theory becomes irrelevant when one can just look at the data and make connections. Anderson claims that hypotheses are no longer necessary because the data contains all of the facts, and if one simply analyzes the data then they will be able to understand the reasoning behind a problem. Another point Anderson brings up is the idea that correlation can be used to prove causation, which goes against one of the fundamental rules of scientific theory. He ultimately believes that people make mistakes and have trouble noticing patterns, but if one just throws all of the massive amounts of data into a computer and runs it through a bunch of algorithms, then the computer will show answers that people have never been able to find on their own through science. 

Anderson makes some solid points in his argument, but
