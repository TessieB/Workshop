### Introduction
The first three sustainable goals of the United Nations are to end poverty, exterminate food-insecurity, and make sure that people from all countries have the ability to live a healthy life. These three goals cover the items that are necessary for life, regardless of the quality of that life. They are vital for survival, for allowing people to wake up every day, put air in their lungs, and open their eyes to the world around them. The fact that the fourth United Nations sustainability goal, ensuring education for all and promoting life-long learning opportunities, comes right after these three serves to illustrate the importance of education and where it stands on the human development scale. [3] Education is vital in today’s world because it enables one to escape the chains of poverty, gain access to the foodstuff they need, and live a healthier life. [10] The reason why education is the fourth sustainability goal is because it can help to rid the world of the first three problems and open opportunities for a better quality of life. Education helps to end some of the unfreedoms that people experience such as hunger, poor healthcare, and lack of resources through raising one’s ability to earn higher wages and is necessary for the achievement of the rest of the United Nation’s Sustainability goals.

Unfortunately, all of the words in the world cannot change the fact that for some countries, providing education to their citizens is proving to be a difficult undertaking. One of these countries, which is the location this research will focus on, is Nigeria. In Nigeria, there are currently around 10.5 million children between the ages 5-14 who do not attend school and even those who do manage to receive an education oftentimes do not obtain a quality one. [2] There are several factors making it difficult for children to receive an education, including a lack of resources, an inadequate number of teachers available, and a disproportionate spread of educational facilities. Children living in rural areas are especially being affected by all of these factors and experience problems with accessibility to the existing facilities. [6, 7, 8, 9] The research question this paper is seeking to address is what geospatial methods can be used to obtain better data for Nigeria so that they can better plan where to build new schools, how to increase accessibility to those schools, and what areas need the most aide. If the data is used to mitigate these problems, then the others mentioned previously should follow once the educational conditions improve.

### Inquiry Type
This research question is both explanatory and evaluative in nature because it seeks to find the causes that are leading to Nigeria’s poor education system and make judgements on what can be improved through the use of geospatial data and data science methods. The purpose is to examine the current data on the subject and discover what methods can be used to increase the data that the Nigerian government, along with the rest of the world, can use to help solve this problem or at least mitigate the causes to the greatest extent possible. After investigating the problem, some of the factors that have been identified include, as mentioned above, a lack of resources, large pupil to teacher ratios, and poor accessibility rates to educational facilities, especially for those in rural areas. 

### Methods
Accessibility is a huge issue when it comes to education in Nigeria. Many children have to travel more than 2 km to get to school every day, and much of that traveling is done on foot due to the number and placement of roads available and poverty found within the country. [6] Many of those that manage to reach a school have to deal with overcrowding because schools are disproportionately spread. In order to alleviate these issues, geospatial data and methods are needed to form accurate and updated population maps, road network maps, and poverty maps just to name a few. This way, the government can obtain relevant data to develop better solutions to address the poor school systems at a more affordable cost, rather than spending a bunch of money on a census that will soon be outdated. 

The first method to focus on is the Bayesian model. This model takes clustered data from small predefined areas throughout the country and uses it to make predictions on certain aspects of the population for the unobserved regions. This is a bottom-up approach and is a much cheaper way of attaining population information for the government because it is only necessary for the government to procure data on the specified clusters, rather than the whole country. In one study that was conducted in Nigeria, the Bayesian model was used to predict the proportion of the under-five population in 1x1 km grid cells. The data was taken from three nationally representative household surveys of Nigeria, which were the 2008 DHS, the 2010 MIS, and the 2010 LSMS-ISA panel. For the surveys taken, there were two stages. The first stage clusters, which were based on census enumeration areas, where chosen and separated by rural and urban classifications. Once this was done, the second stage was enacted and consisted of a random sample of households that were picked from the rural and urban clusters. A proportionate number of households was chosen for each cluster depending on the population in that area. The households were displaced to protect anonymity of those who participated, and the data was placed into a spatial database, where it was linked to administrative divisions and checked for validity.

In order to predict the under-five proportion of the population without survey data, it was necessary to look at the spatial covariance structure in the survey data and the relationships between the covariates. Once a list of covariates was formed, the number of covariates was reduced through the use of a non-spatial generalized linear regression model. Afterwards, the selected covariates were then used in the Bayesian approach. This reduction of covariates was done to prevent any chance of over-fitting. Table 1 shows how different covariates were selected for a variety of model specifications.


 
The chosen covariates and data from the household surveys were then fed into a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model, which was implemented through a stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) approach with INLA for inference. This produced maps of the estimated proportion of Nigeria’s population that are children under the age of 5, as shown below in Figure 3. [1]

 

The other method this research is focusing on is the random forest method, which has been used successfully in Nigeria to create population maps. Random forest is a technique which takes census data and other covariates to distribute the population based on different weights for each area. Those weights are compared with the census data to determine how many people live in what areas throughout the country, rather than only having an overall number taken from one of the census regions. This method was used in Nigeria to create up to date population maps without needing to constantly conduct censuses and spend a bunch of money on obtaining current data on the population. 

The first step with random forest is to gather a list of covariates. Once these are on hand, the list needs to be narrowed down in order to avoid over-fitting. This can be done by running the covariates through an algorithm that determines which ones are most relevant to where the population is aggregated and to what degree dependent on the location involved. The random forest method then takes the census data and the selected covariates and combines them with decision trees that are considered weak in order to create a stronger learner. These trees are then used to provide a weighting layer that allows for a dasymetric redistribution of population counts from census-based administrative units to grid cells. The map below shows data taken from a Nigerian census and mapped using a random-forest based dasymetric redistribution to provide a current record of Nigeria’s population. [4, 5]

### Discussion
Ultimately, both of these methods are very useful for collecting data on the overall population of Nigeria, which in turn aids government leaders in choosing ways to address the education problem. With the Bayesian model, there is a lot of possibility because the only surveys that need to be conducted are on a smaller scale than the national level and can be done much more easily and cheaply. With the results of the under-five proportion population map, there is a clear representation of where primary school aged children reside and what areas need more educational facilities. There is also a certainty graph positioned right next to the proportion population map to show what areas are less certain in their predictions based on the data the model had to work with. This can be factored in when deciding how much risk the government wants to take in choosing where to place schools. 

The random forest model is also a great tool for the country to use because it is able to work with covariates in order to determine what numbers of people are residing where. Having updated population maps is vital when determining placement of schools, because schools need to be placed in areas that will benefit the largest number of children. It is clear from the examples above that these two models are both tools that Nigeria needs to utilize to begin to address the problems with education accessibility. There are so many possibilities for the educational future of Nigeria if the country is equipped with the data it needs to move forward.

### Further Study/Gap
While the methods listed above are very helpful in providing information for Nigeria, there is still not a whole lot of data available about the different aspects of Nigeria, especially the rural areas. Additionally, as the data science methods are a newer concept, there is not much information on how any data found using geospatial methods has been used to improve school systems. Currently, there is a gap on how useful any data obtained will be in allowing the government to make changes in how they run their educational programs and in what data is available in rural areas that can be fed into these data science methods discussed above. As seen in the part discussing how the Bayesian model was used to predict the proportion of children under the age of five, there is a lot of uncertainty as to how accurate the data is in the north, which tends to be more rural and is therefore lacking in data.
