## 6. What was the Washington Concensus? How did it propose to improve upon models of economic growth?

The Washington Concensus was a list of ten items that summarized various suggested policy reforms in an effort to aid in the success of firms in developing countries. At the time, economists were working with a model that essentially stated that the more capital and labor poured into a firm, the higher the outcome will be. People believed that if countries had enough aid and labor forces, then they would progress in their path towards development. This was not working, however, but economists were not ready to let go of their model. They decided that the issue must lie with the government's policies not allowing firms to grow instead of their economic model, so large institutions such as the World Bank and IMF started to come up with some possible policy options that countries could incorporate, which eventually became the Washington Concensus. Unfortunately, these attempts to push for free markets in developing countries did not result in the firms' successes as hoped.

## What was the Harrod-Domar model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what was the impact of his work on development?

The Harrod-Domar model said that if you take capital and labor and combine them, you will receive output. Therefore, the more capital and labor invested in a firm, the more output there will be. According to this model, the economy is based on the success of firms, so the solution to a lacking economy is to provide either financial aid or labor and then that economy should flourish. Considering that developing countries had plenty of labor, it seemed clear that they needed more capital to build their economy. Walter Rostow was an economist who came up with the neoclassical growth model, which was similar to the Harrod-Domar model but added a third element, technical change. According to Roslow, growth is dependent on labor, capital, and this mysertious technical change. He never chose to explain what technical change was, but just threw everything that was not capital or labor into that category. Ultimately, Roslow's model worked better with the data collected than the Harrod-Domar model, but it did not explain what technical changes were, which was the missing piece that people needed to understand.
